## Git Revert package

Revert a file back to HEAD after you've really messed it up.


When in a file that needs reverting, press <kbd>ctrl-cmd-r</kbd> to revert the file.

There is also a context menu item in both the editor and tree-view titled **git revert**.

<kbd>Esc</kbd> key closes the modal.
